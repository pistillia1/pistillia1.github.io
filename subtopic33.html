                <td>Phone addiction, also known as "nomophobia," is the excessive and compulsive use of smartphones, causing anxiety and agitation when unable to access them. As of 2024, 6.3% of smartphone users are affected by this addiction. The design of smartphones, with their engaging features like notifications and sounds, contributes to this behavior. Overuse of phones can lead to negative effects such as sleep deficits, anxiety, impaired relationships, and cognitive decline. Research shows chronic phone use can impact brain chemistry, including GABA dysfunction and reduced grey matter, similar to substance use disorders. Treatment options for phone addiction include cognitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, and motivational interviewing. Recognizing the signs of phone addiction, such as neglecting responsibilities and social isolation, is essential in seeking help.</td>

                <td>A recent experiment where participants surrendered their phones for an evening revealed mixed reactions: anxiety and irritability for some, while others felt liberated. Smartphones, essential in modern life, can foster addiction, leading to negative impacts on health, relationships, and productivity. Signs of phone addiction include compulsive use, emotional reliance, and impaired social interactions. A study found 50% of participants showed problematic use. To regain control, individuals can practice self-awareness, set boundaries, and explore alternative coping strategies. In severe cases, professional help may be necessary to manage digital dependency and restore balance to personal and professional life.</td>
