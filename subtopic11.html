                <td>This is a very informative article about the signs of potential Social media addiction. Social media addiction is a growing issue characterized by excessive use and a strong desire to check platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This addiction leads to negative effects on mental health, relationships, and daily life. It is driven by rewards such as likes and comments that trigger dopamine in the brain, similar to drug addiction. Symptoms include mood changes, compulsive use, and withdrawal when offline. Social media addiction is linked to lower self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, particularly in young people. Treatment includes reducing screen time and seeking professional help, such as therapy, to develop healthier habits.</td>

                <td>This is an article about how teens are particularly vulnerable to the addictive nature of social media due to their rapidly developing brains. Social media triggers dopamine surges in the brain, creating pleasure and reinforcing the desire for more engagement, much like gambling or drug use. This can lead to compulsive behaviors and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and body image problems. Parents and guardians can help by encouraging healthy coping mechanisms, setting screen time limits, and fostering open communication about social media use. They can also support their teens in seeking professional help if needed, ensuring a healthier relationship with social media.</td>
