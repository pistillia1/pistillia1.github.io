                <td>Video game addiction, also known as internet gaming disorder, involves a loss of control over gaming, leading to negative impacts on life areas such as relationships, work, and self-care. This condition can affect children, teens, and adults, with males being more susceptible. Video games trigger dopamine release in the brain, reinforcing addictive behavior similar to gambling. Symptoms include poor performance at school/work, withdrawal symptoms, and neglecting responsibilities. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, and family counseling. Early intervention is key to preventing long-term effects on mental and physical health.</td>

                <td>Video game addiction, or internet gaming disorder, is a serious condition that leads to significant personal and social impairment, affecting children, teens, and adults. Although prevalence rates are debated, studies suggest that about 2% of children and adolescents may be affected. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5-TR includes internet gaming disorder for further research but does not officially classify it as a behavioral addiction like gambling. Symptoms include preoccupation with gaming, withdrawal, tolerance, and neglect of other life responsibilities. Debate exists over whether video game addiction should be considered a mental disorder, with estimates of its prevalence ranging from 0.3% to 1%, though some studies suggest higher rates.</td>
